### Main Goals of Project:
Create a GUI tool for `labelling` and `counting` the `number of ocelli (feather eyes)` for a given picture of a peacock.

### Problem definition and steps to follow:
So, we will be given an image of a peacock and we will have to count the number of ocelli(s) in the feathers of the bird.

The problem lies in the category of problems where we identify as well as count the occurance of a specific object in image.
What we will basically do is match parts of the uploaded image to an image of ocelli and mark the boundary wherever the pattern matches.

### Results of the project
We will display the uploaded image along with the places where there is an ocelli marked by a rectangle.
Also we will display the count of total ocellis found from the image.

### Dataset Requirement:
We will require a dataset of pictures of peacock for testing and development of out project.
We will look for public datasets and if its not present we will try to scrape images from internet.
